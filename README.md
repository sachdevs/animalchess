# animalchess
friend wanted to play me in animal chess. so i quickly made this. (self govern the rules)
- you're missing gitignore -> oops
- you've bad code -> pls dont read it i swear i normally write better
- you've bugs -> my bad pls submit PR and ill merge it
- have you any live version? -> nah i just use a temp free heroku thing. Dont really want to publish it's public dns :'). I recommend go deploy it to some AWS box and run it there for you and your homies.
